# Advent of Code

My Advent of Code solutions in JavaScript (might try TypeScript as well later).

Test setup inspired by [Kyle Shevlin](https://github.com/kyleshevlin/advent-of-code-2022).

## How

For every new day export the `part1` and `part2` functions, import them into the corresponding test file, add input(s) and expected outputs, then run using `yarn test:watch <day>` and code away. :)
